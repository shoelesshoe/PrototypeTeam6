# Notepad# and Big AI 6 Prototype (Big Hero 6)
## By: Team 6

## What is Big AI 6?
The AI that we are creating is called Big AI 6, which its name was inspired by the character Big Hero 6 movie as it will be helping teams to organise ideas for projects, making their lives easier for them, just like how Baymax helps Hiro in his daily life. 

## How is Big AI 6 created and how does it work?
Big AI 6 uses the tool “Speech Lab” from AI-Bricks to convert speech into text. Next, it analyses the text and captures out key terms mentioned and displays them in a desktop application we have created called Notepad#. It will additionally provide links of the meaning of the complex terms mentioned to improve clarity of what the speaker is saying.

1. The User can either input the manuscript directly or they can use our speech to text feature to get the manuscript from a video and submit that into the AI
2. We will take that and compare how similar the sentences are to each other
3. We will the user how many sentences they want to simplified summary to be
4. We will then produce the least similar sentences, hence providing an apt summary of the content to the best of the ability.

## What can Big AI 6 do for you?
The device can also be used in online teaching as it will summarise what the teacher said into bite sized pieces to allow a student to understand a topic and will also contain links to various websites to allow the student learn more about the topic and also practice their understanding of the topic.
